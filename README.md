# Reference Data Lookup Tool

This application allows you to search for **Wikidata IDs** and display their corresponding authority record references.  

The workflow consists of two main steps:

1. **Search input (SearchBox):** Queries the [Wikidata API](https://www.wikidata.org/w/api.php) for items based on a Wikidata ID and extracts their identifiers.  
2. **Display (AppView):** Shows the retrieved reference data, with the option to copy either the full URI of the reference entry or just the identifier itself.  

It is a **live-based solution**: no static dataset is used. All information is loaded in real time from Wikidata.
